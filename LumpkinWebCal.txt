Jason,

We've identified the following priority items for the WebCal:

1.  Filters for the calendar to be viewed by:
	-Staff
		-View all
		-View Recreation Programs
			-View by specific team, program (i.e., soccer, baseball, etc.), location
		-View Cultural Arts Programs
			-View by specific program and location
		-View After Hours Programs
			-View by specific program and location
		-View Private Scheduled Events
			(i.e. weddings)
	-Public
	 	-View all
		-View Recreation Programs
			-View by specific team, program (i.e., soccer, baseball, etc.), location
		-View Cultural Arts Programs
			--View by specific program and location
		
	*Details in WebCal to include:
		A.  Event name
		B.  Event time
		C.  Event location
		d.  Event details?

2.  Web Cal must be linked to tblEvents in the Lumpkin database
	A.  All changes, updates, deletions staff make to events must be reflected in WebCal
	B.  We can accomplish this by building functionality to allow Staff to click on a day 
	    which has an existing schedule and be able to hyperlink directly to existing pages 
            in the web application where they can make edits to the event (i.e. rain delay, 
            change location, etc.).
	C.  Staff should be able to double click any day and hyperlink to existing pages in
            the web application which will allow them to add a new event.
